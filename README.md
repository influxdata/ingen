ingen
=====

`ingen` is an InfluxDB data generation tool for testing query performance of InfluxDB and ifql.

`ingen` generates fully compacted `.tsm` data directly into existing InfluxDB directories and 
updates the metadata, adding the database, retention policy and shard definitions. When `influxd`
is started, the generated database will be immediately available for querying.

This tool is intended to generate data fast and in a deterministic state.

performance
-----------

Performance is expected to be considerably higher, given it bypasses the entire write path. 

The following examples create a database with a 24h shard group duration and data that spans 4 shards.

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Series            | 100,000     |
| Points per Series | 1000        |
| Shards            | 4           |
| Points per shard  | 25,000,000  |
| Total Points      | 100,000,000 |
